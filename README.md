# MLDM_HWs 
Machine Learning and Data Mining Projects (2022-2023).

This repo demonstrates multiple Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques including:
1. Data Handling and Data Manipulation 
2. Applying Linear Regression under multiple sets.
3. Applying Classification and feature engineering techniques to reach an accuracy limit.
4. Study of Regularization effects.
5. Study of different Quality metrics and the effect of GridSearchCV to find the optimal value for k in KNeighborsClassifier.
6. Applying DecisionTrees and ROC AUC score on [Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset](https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2).
7. study Ensembles by comparing mean-square error between kNN regressor, random forest regressor and stacking regressor on [California Housing dataset](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html).
8. Traning Neural Network Transformer-based model for images classification task.
9. Dog breed Identification using Transfer Learning and CNN Auto Encoders on [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data).
